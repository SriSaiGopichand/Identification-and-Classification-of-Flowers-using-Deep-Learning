## Identification and Classification of flowers using Deep Learning

## Abstract:

The proposed research proposes the identification of different types of flowers using advanced deep learning-based higher-order techniques. Because of this, different image classification algorithms will be implemented on the flowers' classification by their appearance.

## Characteristics:

Image Preprocessing: Cleaning, preparation of flower images for analysis.
Model development: The work proposes the design and training of CNN models, optimized for each VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNet50, in classifying flora species.
Webcam Flower Detection: Detect flowers in real time, either from the user's webcam or image upload, using a web-based, user-friendly interface powered by Gradio.
Performance Evaluation: Evaluate model accuracy and performance by considering metrics involving accuracy and the confusion matrix.
Visualisation: Visualise findings and predictions using informative plots.

## Findings:

The model classifies species of flowers highly effectively, while the evaluation metrics are also very detailed.
